<h1>
    MVC Demo App
</h1>
<p>
    The purpose of this application is to demonstrate a CRUD  form in MVC.  
</p>

<p>
    <h3>Features:</h3>
    <ul style="width: 600px;">
        <li>
            Two levels of user authorization: read-write and read-only.  Use the buttons below to decide your access level and view the CRUD form.  To change your authorization level, you will have to use your browser's address bar to get back to the home page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Code reuse: There is only 1 view used for viewing a record, creating a new record, and updating an existing record, in contrast to the multiple views that MVC scaffolding creates by default.  The single view approach results in more maintainable code, because if new fields are added to the CRUD form, only one view has to be changed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cross-browser compatability: In the Edit view, the Start Date field is compatible with both browsers that support the HTML 5 date picker control (Google Chrome), and those that do not (Internet Explorer, Firefox).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cosmetic bug fix: fixed a vertical alignment issue in the Edit view that existed in the default code generated by MVC scaffolding.
        </li>
    </ul>
